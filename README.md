Adding the GTP4ALL and pyttsx3 (text to speech) libraries into one chunk. This can be used by anyone in their current stack.

## Installation:

For Mac and Linux users, change the `python` to `python3` for version specification 

## MAC USERS:
*If you are on anything less than MACOSX 12.6 (Monterrey). You CANNOT run gpt4all.*
I learned this the hard way.

the idea is to be able to use this chunk of code in a future project. please feel welcome to use this script to test the functionality of the GPT4ALL mixed with 
PYTTSX3
