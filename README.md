# GPT4ALLxPYTTSX3
Adding the GTP4ALL and pyttsx3 (text to speech) libraries into one chunk. This can be used by anyone in their current stack.

## Installation:
```pip install gpt4all```
```pip install pyttsx3```

## Usage:
``python GPT4ALLxPYTTSX3.py``
For Mac and Linux users, change the `python` to `python3` for version specification 

## MAC USERS:
if you are on anything less than MACOSX 12.6 (Monterrey). ### You cannot run gpt4all. 

the idea is to be able to use this chunk of code in a future project. please feel welcome to use this script to test the functionality of the GPT4ALL mixed with 
PYTTSX3 

*I may make this library private in the future as one of my future projects may include this.*
